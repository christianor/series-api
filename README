Search For TV-Series
http://series-ortiz.rhcloud.com/series?name=dexter

A search returns series information and a IMDB-id encapsulated by the id property or xml tag.
How To Work With The Search Result
Use the id to get additional tv-series information and seasons/episodes. The above query for the tv-series dexter returns the IMDB-id "tt0773262"
Note Search results won't be cached and therefore searching can be slower than retrieving a tv-series directly by id
Now use the IMDB-id to get the storyline and the number of seasons:

http://series-ortiz.rhcloud.com/series/tt0773262/info

Or to get the episodes of a season:

http://series-ortiz.rhcloud.com/series/tt0773262/season/1

Or even get all episodes of the tv-series:

http://series-ortiz.rhcloud.com/series/tt0773262

Unstable Dependig on the number of seasons full series requests may take a bit to long. Openshift in connection with Play! seems to return a "502 Proxy Error" if requests takes longer than ~30 seconds. Try using the "series-id/season/number" URL instead
Caching
TV-Series information will be cached after a request for a day. The most popular tv-series will be cached on a daily basis.
Data Formats
Every request returns JSON data by default, if you want to see the result in XML format, just add a .xml before the query string, as follows:

http://series-ortiz.rhcloud.com/series.xml?name=dexter

If you want to use the resulting data over JSONP just add a "callback" parameter to the query string:

http://series-ortiz.rhcloud.com/series?name=dexter&callback=func

In this case func is the callback function.

TheTVDB.com Wrapper New!
The IMDB Series API does now support querying for TheTVDB.com entries. You only have to append s=thetvdb to the query string, to specify the service.
Example: http://series-ortiz.rhcloud.com/series?name=dexter&callback=func&s=thetvdb
